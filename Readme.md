- Hello! This is the project i made for OSF Digital - Frontend Academy. In this project i used the languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- On the first day, i created the navigation bar, with some visual features. Like hover button, it doesn't redirect to another pages because they will be created after.
- On the second day, i spend some time creating the footer, with the marketplace data (adress, telephones) and the link phrases to other products;
- On the third day, i changed the plan, and focused on the cart matters (like Product details, images, etc), and working to developing the selling system.
- On the fourth day, i had problems with git, so i needed to create a new repository. Also i continued to create cart system, putting products lists, images and cart content.
- Also, still on the fourth day, i initiated the cart page creation with a different layout, i will improve this feature to be more accessible.
